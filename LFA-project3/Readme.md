Program that reads transistions and final states of a DFA and turns it into the minimal DFA version by: <br>
-eliminating unreachable states<br>
-creating partitions of equivalents states <br>
-creating the dfa based on the fact that equivalent states became the same state.
-deleting the states from which we can't reach a final state
Initial state is consideres q0.
